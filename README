    maschinemk2.rs is an open-source implementation of native instruments's USB HID
    protocol for the maschine mk2 devices.

    This fork's current support is only for the maschine mk2, as that is what I was missing.
    I made it as I have used my maschine mk2 in midi mode with ableton for years now,
    and I am quite dependent on it to record my music.

    also it only runs on linux. if you're on win/mac you don't need this.

    you'll need rustc and cargo to build/run. do this:

        $ cargo build --release
        $ cargo run --release /dev/hidraw0

    replace `/dev/hidraw0` with the path to your mk2. you may need to tweak
    your udev permissions to have it accessible from your normal user account.
        ... or just sudo it...

    There is also a shellscript to turn on all the lights. Do this:

        $ ./insert_colors

    while running, you'll have an ALSA MIDI out port which will send MIDI events
    (note on, note off, poly aftertouch) generated by playing the pads. also,
    the pads will light up while being played. it's all quite fancy.

    Please use oscdump or similar to identify the specific buttons are available:

        $oscdump -L 42435

    NOTE!!!: roller encoders are sent as weird binary in OSC messages, Maybe should fix...


    TODO:
        - Make osc actually mappable, the current mapping does not include toggles or encoders so it's basically unusable unless you map it very carefully.
        - Put the goddamn lights in the right order!
        - some kind of Osc to midi mappings when the osc mappings are correct.
